I am a Haskell engineer, currently working at Kitty Hawk and living in the San Francisco bay area.
I came across Haskell in 2017, more or less by accident, and after being completely fascinated
by it, started writing Haskell professionally in 2018.
This blog contains some random Haskell topics I happen to find worth writing about.

Besides Haskell I'm passionate about a few other things:

- Snooker, which is by far my biggest hobby. Below is my son "playing" snooker, and
my John Parris Ultimate cue.
- Commercial aviation and frequent flyer programs.
- Gambling - blackjack, video poker, ultimate texas holdem, and what not.

I want to personally thank you for being interested in Haskell, and for reading this blog. I
hope it is useful to you in some small ways.
